## BNP Course

These are slides and demo notebooks for a short course on BNP given at ENSAE ParisTech in 2016-17-18.

### Course material
Complete references are in the slides. Here is a summary of the main references for each lecture:
* lecture 1: *GPs*: Chapter 2 of Rasmussen and Williams, Chapter 4 of Orbanz.
* lecture 2: *GPs*: Chapters 3 and 5 of Rasmussen and Williams; *DPs*: Chapter 2 of Orbanz, Chapter 2 of Hjort et al.  

### Notebooks
Code is Python 3 in jupyter notebooks. Notebooks are numbered in increasing level of course understanding needed. If you are new to Python, I recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) distribution. Then simply
`cd notebooks`
and run
`jupyter notebook [name of the notebook]`. Alternately, you can visualize the notebooks here on Github, or download the static html versions in the `notebooks` subdirectory.

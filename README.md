## BNP Course

These are slides and demo notebooks for a 9h course on BNP given at ENSAE ParisTech in 2017.

Code is Python 3 in jupyter notebooks. If you are new to Python, I recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) distribution. Then simply
`cd notebooks`
and run
`jupyter notebook [name of the notebook]`. Alternately, you can visualize the notebooks here on Github, or doanlad the static html versions in the `notebooks` subdirectory.
